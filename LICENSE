PREAMBLE
====================================================================

SantAI (and its subprojects MedAI and VetAI) is an open, clinically oriented AI framework
dedicated to medical and veterinary practice.

Its mission is to ensure transparent, ethical, and scientifically validated access
to artificial intelligence in the health sciences.

This license ensures that:
- SantAI remains free and open, in the spirit of the GNU AGPLv3;
- clinical and scientific integrity are preserved through centralized curation and governance;
- misuse or fragmentation of medical data or reasoning chains is prevented.

The AI GPL v1 (SantAI License) extends the AGPLv3 with governance and attribution clauses
specific to medical AI ecosystems.

====================================================================
ARTICLE 1 — BASE LICENSE
====================================================================

1. The AI GPL v1 is fully compatible with the GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPLv3).  
2. All rights and obligations from AGPLv3 apply unless specifically modified by this license.  
3. Any conflict between this license and AGPLv3 shall be resolved in favor of maintaining
   both software freedom and clinical safety.

====================================================================
ARTICLE 2 — CONTROLLED FORKS AND REDISTRIBUTION
====================================================================

1. Redistribution and modification of SantAI, MedAI, or VetAI source code are authorized
   only within the official ecosystem, hosted at:
   → https://github.com/medai
   or any successor designated by the project founder.

2. Public forks, mirrors, or derivative projects using the SantAI, MedAI, or VetAI
   names, logos, datasets, or distinctive elements require written consent
   from the copyright holder.

3. The “No Fork without Governance” clause exists to prevent:
   - dissemination of clinical misinformation,
   - degradation of curated datasets or reasoning modules,
   - fragmentation of the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) corpus.

4. Modifications and improvements must be proposed as Pull Requests
   or through official collaboration channels defined by SantAI governance.

5. Private internal forks for evaluation, integration, or research are permitted
   if not publicly deployed or redistributed.

====================================================================
ARTICLE 3 — SCIENTIFIC AND CLINICAL RESPONSIBILITY
====================================================================

1. SantAI distributes curated and validated RAG datasets and clinical modules.  
2. Any third-party derivative must not claim compatibility or endorsement
   with SantAI, MedAI, or VetAI without written authorization.  
3. Misuse of SantAI names, models, or data in clinical decision systems outside
   the official governance may constitute false representation and expose
   the user to liability.  
4. The SantAI License does not guarantee clinical performance and must not
   replace professional judgment.

====================================================================
ARTICLE 4 — GOVERNANCE AND DECISION AUTHORITY
====================================================================

1. SantAI operates under a Founder Governance Model (“benevolent dictator for life”)
   until transition to a scientific board or foundation structure.

2. The founder, Olivier Bénard, retains ultimate authority over:
   - scientific validation and content integration,
   - approval of external modules or dataset merges,
   - official releases and naming conventions.

3. Funding sources include:
   - public or institutional grants,
   - ethical partnerships and donations,
   - voluntary community contributions.

4. All public versions must maintain free and open access for educational
   and clinical use.

====================================================================
ARTICLE 5 — COMPATIBILITY AND COPYLEFT INTEGRITY
====================================================================

1. AI GPL v1 preserves all AGPLv3 freedoms:
   - use, study, modification, redistribution.  
2. Derivative works may integrate AI GPL v1 software only if they remain open
   and provide corresponding source code.  
3. Integration with non-free components must be clearly documented and isolated.  
4. Forks that compromise scientific, ethical, or technical integrity are prohibited
   and may be deauthorized by the licensor.

====================================================================
ARTICLE 6 — TRADEMARK AND NAME USAGE
====================================================================

1. The terms SantAI, MedAI, and VetAI are protected identifiers
   and not automatically licensed by this document.  
2. Authorized use is limited to officially approved derivatives and publications.  
3. Use of the SantAI marks in promotional or commercial materials requires explicit
   written permission.

====================================================================
ARTICLE 7 — LEGAL COMPATIBILITY
====================================================================

1. The AI GPL v1 shall be interpreted consistently with AGPLv3 principles
   and international copyright law.
